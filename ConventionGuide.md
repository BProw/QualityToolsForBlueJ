## Style Convention Precedence and References

Project-specific conventions take precedence and are specified below.
If no project-specific convention is applicable, use the Sun Convention guide.
If something is not covered in the project-specific or the Sun Convention guide, use the Google Convention guide.
If a topic is not covered any guides, use best judgement and consider opening a developers' issue.
